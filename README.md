# Employee-Salary-Prediction
  💼 A machine learning project that predicts whether an employee's income exceeds 50K/year based on demographic and employment features. Built using logistic regression, data preprocessing, and Gradio for interactive web interface. Hosted with Ngrok for public access.

Great! Here's a complete and well-structured README.md for your GitHub repository:

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a cleaned and modified version of the UCI Adult Income dataset. It includes features like:

* Age
* Education Number
* Capital Gain
* Capital Loss
* Hours Per Week
* Workclass
* Marital Status
* Occupation
* Relationship
* Race
* Native Country
* Gender
* Income (Target Variable)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)
* Scikit-learn (Modeling & Preprocessing)
* Gradio (Web Interface)
* Ngrok (External Access to Interface)
* Google Colab (Development Environment)

## 📊 Model

* Algorithm: Logistic Regression
* Preprocessing:

  * Label Encoding for categorical target/columns
  * One-hot encoding for categorical features
  * StandardScaler for feature normalization

## 🖥️ Interface

The model is deployed with a Gradio interface, allowing users to input feature values and receive predictions in real time.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or upload the `.ipynb` file into Google Colab.
2. Ensure your dataset (`Emp_sal_ds.csv`) is uploaded to your Colab environment.
3. Install dependencies:

   ```python
   !pip install gradio pyngrok
   ```
4. Run the notebook step by step.
5. A public URL will be generated by Ngrok — use that to access your web app.

## 🌐 Live Demo

Once you run the notebook in Colab, a `Public URL` will be generated and printed. Share that URL to allow others to try the app.

## ✅ Output Example

* Input: Age = 45, Hours Per Week = 40, Occupation = Exec-managerial, Gender = Male
* Output: `Income >50K`

## 📌 Notes

* Ngrok token is required. Only one token setup per session.
* Users who download this project must replace with their own Ngrok token to access the public link.
* Gender values are mapped from "Male"/"Female" to 1/0 internally.

## 🙌 Credits

This project was developed collaboratively using Python and open-source tools to demonstrate real-world ML deployment in a simple and understandable manner.
